# WeConnect DUCS
Connecting with alumni can be challenging for freshers who are seeking guidance and mentorship. To address this issue, we developed "WeConnect," a platform that directly connects students with their alumni.

WeConnect provides a live conversation feature that enables students to interact with alumni in real time. Recognizing the value of shared experiences, we also introduced a "Posts" feature where individuals can share their life lessons and experiences with the broader community. This fosters a culture of learning and growth, benefiting everyone involved.
